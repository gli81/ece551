Doing make clean
rm -rf *.o *~ ships-step1 ships-step2 ships-step3 ships-step4
Running your test cases
-------------------------
 This test case will run 
 ships-step3 
 With arguments 
 ./inputs/3ship/minLongNTank.txt ./inputs/cargo1.txt 
-------------------------
I need to compile your code for ships-step3 (make ships-step3)

Compiling ships-step3
g++ -c -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 utils.cpp
g++ -o ships-step3 -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 step3.cpp utils.o
rm utils.o
