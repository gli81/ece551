Running your test cases
-------------------------
 This test case will run 
 launches-step1 
 With arguments 
 ./test-step1/test-dup-dot.txt 
-------------------------
I need to compile your code for launches-step1 (make launches-step1)

Compiling launches-step1
rm -f  *~ launches-step? launches-step4-debug
gcc -c -Wall -Werror --std=gnu99 -pedantic -ggdb3 step1.c
gcc -c -Wall -Werror --std=gnu99 -pedantic -ggdb3 myinput.c
gcc -o launches-step1 -Wall -Werror --std=gnu99 -pedantic -ggdb3 step1.o myinput.o provided.o dummy-s2.o dummy-s3.o -lm
